# Empowering Trauma & EMS Quality Improvement with R

## Why this work matters

- EMS and trauma systems critically depend on timely, accurate performance data  
- Hospitals and EMS services often lack analytic infrastructure or staff  
- Most U.S. jurisdictions require reporting to a centralized trauma registry and EMS registry
- Each hospital and EMS service have access to their own raw data via their Electronic Health Record (EHR)
- National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) define strong data standards and naming conventions for data elements
- Level I, II, and III hospitals report to NTDB, while all EMS service data will be reported to NEMSIS
- NEMSIS provides national/state/region level performance data, but local implementations for services is hard (many volunteer, low uptake of analytical resources)
- American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) provides some performance data, but not all hospitals report to TQIP (mostly Level I, II, and III programs)
- EHRs used by hospitals and EMS providers typically provide some analytical resources and reporting software, but this can be inflexible and difficult to use
- `traumar` and `nemsqar` bring modern R-based QI tools to frontline users

## Overview: National Context

- **NTDB**: trauma registry data, hospital-based  
- **NEMSIS**: national EMS data, prehospital events  
- **NEMSQA**: National EMS Quality Alliance
 - Non-profit, expert EMS stakeholders, consistent measure development process
 - Founded in 2019. In the last 3-4 years, has published 21 measures of EMS service quality for public use
- **SEQIC**: System Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee
 - Iowa-based group of trauma stakeholders led by Iowa HHS
 - Over the past two decades, the group has designed multiple QI measures for the Iowa trauma system
- Consistent element names, standardized formats  
- Ideal foundation for reproducible QI pipelines

## Introducing `traumar`

- Implements metrics driven the by academic literature
 - Risk-adjusted mortality metrics
  - W, M, and Z scores (Based on the Major Trauma Outcomes Study)
  - Relative mortality metric (RMM) from Napoli et a. (2017)
- Built to calculate SEQIC indicators 
- Friendly to NTDB data formats and others  
- Calculates measures for Level I, II, III, and IV trauma centers
- Can perform analyses at multiple levels (i.e. hospital, regional, state)

---

## `traumar`: Example Functions

```r
traumar::seqic_airway_by_year(data)
traumar::trauma_performance(data)
traumar::rmm(data)
traumar::rm_bin_summary(data)
```

---

## `nemsqar`: EMS QI with NEMSIS

- Built on NEMSQA performance measures
- Automatically detects and validates key elements
- Scales to full state-level EMS datasets

---

## `nemsqar`: Example Functions

```r
nemsqar::adult_population(data)
nemsqar::trauma_population(data)
nemsqar::respiratory_01(data)

```

- `*_population()` functions define eligible cases
- Wrapper functions implement full NEMSQA measures

---

## Real-world Use

- `traumar`: Used to report risk-adjusted benchmarking and SEQIC indicators for all 120 trauma centers in Iowa

- `nemsqar`: Supporting the first statewide reporting on all NEMSQA measures in Iowa (only a few other states have done this with all 21 measures)

- Reproducible, interpretable, fast

--- 

## Needs

- You!
- I welcome other developers with expertise in trauma, EMS, epidemiology, and data science to become a collaborator
- I am currently the only developer on the `traumar` project and there is so much room to grow
- `nemsqar` has one other developer 
 - Samuel Kordik: Quality Manager, Dallas Fire, Dallas, TX
- and a contributor 
 - Alyssa Green, Data Scientist, ESO, Kansas
- Please reach out. Open source is all about collaboration and we are very open to more contributors.
