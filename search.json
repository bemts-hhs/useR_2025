    "text": "Why this work matters\n\nEMS and trauma systems critically depend on timely, accurate performance data\n\nHospitals and EMS services often lack analytic infrastructure or staff\n\nMost U.S. jurisdictions require reporting to a centralized trauma registry and EMS registry\nEach hospital and EMS service have access to their own raw data via their Electronic Health Record (EHR)\nNational Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) define strong data standards and naming conventions for data elements\nLevel I, II, and III hospitals report to NTDB, while all EMS service data will be reported to NEMSIS\nNEMSIS provides national/state/region level performance data, but local implementations for services is hard (many volunteer, low uptake of analytical resources)\nAmerican College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) provides some performance data, but not all hospitals report to TQIP (mostly Level I, II, and III programs)\nEHRs used by hospitals and EMS providers typically provide some analytical resources and reporting software, but this can be inflexible and difficult to use\ntraumar and nemsqar bring modern R-based QI tools to frontline users"
